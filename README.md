# Approval::Ratings::Cli::Gem


## Steps (tentative)
* find site from which to scrape
* inspect elements to see if can use it
* use structure of now playing
* iterate through td's
* using binding.pry to determine elements on which to iterate
* fix duplicates issue in list
* fix find_by_name to return duplicates
* create additional function for printing list of finding_by_number, which is now different from find_by_name because it only returns one vs potentialy > 1 for find_by_name
* fix array length sent to CLI instead of limiting the size of the list in the CLI, because the find_by_name will only return values for those on list, instead of all possible without truncating array
* gemspec
* publish gem
